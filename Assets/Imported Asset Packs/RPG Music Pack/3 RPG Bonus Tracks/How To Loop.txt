IF THE SONG HAS AN INTRO:

1. Add both the "INTRO" and "LOOP" tracks to play at the same time

2. Next, set a delay for the "LOOP" track so that they line up and play sequentially. If you need assistance, listen to the "Fade-Out"
	track for guidance

3. Set the "LOOP" track to loop

IF THE SONG HAS A REVERB TAIL:

1. Add the "LOOP" track

2. Add the "REVERB TAIL" track to the very end of the "LOOP" track 

3. Set the "REVERB TAIL" to play only after the "LOOP" track finishes
